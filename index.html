       Born in Pennsylvania on November 20, 1942, Joe Biden briefly worked as an attorney before turning to politics. He became the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history as well as Delaware's longest-serving senator. His 2008 presidential campaign never gained momentum, but Democratic nominee Barack Obama later selected him as his running mate. When Obama was elected in 2008, Biden became the 47th vice president of the United States. Biden earned a second term as vice president when President Obama was re-elected to the presidency in 2012. In 2017, Obama presented Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction for his service to the United States.“I don’t think any man or woman should run for president unless, No. 1, they know exactly why they would want to be president, and 2, they can look at the folks out there and say, ‘I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy and my passion to do this,’” Biden told Stephen Colbert last week. “And I’d be lying if I said that I knew I was there.”

      Biden became the highest-ranking government official to endorse same-sex marriage in 2012 during an appearance on “Meet the Press.” Soon after, President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage as well.
